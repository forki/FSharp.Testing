# How to get started

## Building FSharp.Testing from source

Just download the repository from github and run the build.cmd. The build of FSharp.Testing only requires the .NET Framework 4.0 to be installed on your machine. Everything else should work out-of-the-box. If not, please take the time to add an issue to this project. After a succesful build you find all the assemblies in a zip file under the "Release" folder.

## Getting FSharp.Testing via the NuGet package manager

If you've got NuGet installed on your machine it gets even easier:

        install-package FSharp.Testing

## How to use it

Todo.
